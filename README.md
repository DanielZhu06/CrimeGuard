# CrimeGuard

## Inspiration
With crime on the rise over the past decade, it is important that people have a suitable way to find a safe area to move to.
## What it does
CrmieGuard allows users to select neighbourhoods in Ottawa and receive a safety score for that neighbourhood. Based off the safety score our app determines if the neighbourhood is safe to move to. The app also displays general crime data of the respected neighbourhood.
## How we built it
We built the app in Android studio using Java and implemented the Yellowcake API.
## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge we faced was regarding the Yellowcake API itself. The API would frequently stop functioning properly thus causing errors in our code.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our group is proud that we were able to create a functioning app even when we had a missing team member on the day of the hackathon.
## What we learned
We learned the importance of planning for potential unforseen events in advance. As that will allow us to allocate a lot more time to building the project itself.
## What's next for CrimeGuard
CrimeGuard intends to expand its range for cities and make accurate predictions for neighbourhoods and cities in the future regarding crime rates.
